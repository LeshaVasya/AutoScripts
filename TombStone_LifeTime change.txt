Please try to reduce the Tombstone Life Time to 2 to test:

Tomb Stone Life Time is 180 days and we might have to reduce it to 2 days so that the Garbage Collection process deletes those objects from the Deleted Objects container within 2 days. However changing the Tomb Stone Life Time period shouldn’t be a problem following things should be considered :
1. AD Replication should be working fine. Issues speeding up the deletion could create lingering objects.  This would only occur if something was deleted and then garbage collection removed it before a DC was made aware of the original deletion.  If we’re not seeing any replication events and all DCs are online it shouldn’t be a problem.
2. Once the objects are deleted we would have to change the TSL back to the original value.
3. This will speed up the permanent deletion of objects so recovery of deleted objects will not be an option after the garbage collection occurs.
Please follow the following steps to reduce the TombStone Lifetime period :  To modify the tombstone lifetime by using Ldp.exe
1. To open Ldp.exe, click Start, click Run, and then type ldp.exe.
2. To connect and bind to the server that hosts the forest root domain of your Active Directory environment, under Connections, click Connect, and then click Bind. 
3. In the console tree, right-click the CN=Directory Service,CN=Windows NT,CN=Services,CN=Configuration container, and then click Modify.
4. In the Modify dialog box, in Edit Entry Attribute, type tombstoneLifetime.
5. In the Modify dialog box, in Values, type the number of days that you want to set for the tombstone lifetime value. (The minimum is 2 days.)
6. In the Modify dialog box, under Operation click Replace, click Enter, and then click Run.
Please feel free to contact me if you need any help in following the action plan.

dsquery * "cn=directory service,cn=windows nt,cn=services,cn=configuration,dc=<forestDN>" –scope base –attr tombstonelifetime
dsquery * "cn=directory service,cn=windows nt,cn=services,cn=configuration,dc=corp,dc=proseware,dc=com" –scope base –attr tombstonelifetime

To determine the tombstone lifetime for the forest using ADSIEdit
Click Start, point to Administrative Tools, and then click ADSI Edit.
In ADSI Edit, right-click ADSI Edit, and then click Connect to.
For Connection Point, click Select a well known Naming Context, and then click Configuration.
If you want to connect to a different domain controller, for Computer, click Select or type a domain or server: (Server | Domain [:port]). Provide the server name or the domain name and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) port (389), and then click OK.
Double-click Configuration, CN=Configuration,DC=ForestRootDomainName, CN=Services, and CN=Windows NT.
Right-click CN=Directory Service, and then click Properties.
In the Attribute column, click tombstoneLifetime.
Note the value in the Value column. If the value is <not set>, the value is 60 days.
